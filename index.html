<div>
    <h1 style="font-size: 200%"><center>Visual Analysis Of COVID-19</center></h1>

    <div>In December 2019, an unknown infectious disease that seems like pneumonia was found in Wuhan, China. 
      Now called Corona Virus, which is a contagious disease. The people affected by this disease had gone through respiratory illness. 
      Many people worldwide lost their lives from the start of the disease to date, and still, people are fighting with the disease. 
      There are many ways out that can help stop the spread of the disease. 
      One of the most effective ways is to share the daily cases and the trends from the start of the disease spread. 
      The following graphics will aid in comprehending the virus's intensity.
    </div>

<!-- Adding 1st Visualization -->

<div>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px"><center>COVID-19 Confirmed Cases across the Globe</center></h2>

    <div>We wish to show all of the countries' confirmed cases. With over 207 nations infected by COVID-19 worldwide 
      and confirmed cases in each, a color map would be the best way to illustrate the disease's intensity around the world. 
      We'll utilize a color hue based on severity to distinguish which countries have the most COVID cases. This visualization shows 
      the number of confirmed cases in various nations, making it easy to learn about the most afflicted countries.

<!-- Adding 2nd Visualization -->

<div style="height: 10px"></div>
<h2><center>A Multiline graph showing the trends in the Daily Confirmed Cases and Death rates over a period across the US region.</center></h2>

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px">A multi-line graph with two separate groups mentioned for confirmed cases and death rates was displayed 
  below in two colors. It will be simpler to understand the differences between the categories and to track the status over time in the 
  US region. In terms of time range, we can accurately represent the categories over time with a monthly difference rather than showing 
  the daily counts of that category, which would make it easier for officials to track the cases and take appropriate action.

    });
  </script>



<!-- 3rd Visualization -->

<div style="height: 70px"></div>
<h2><center>A Grouped Bar Chart comparing the Five most affected countries.</center></h2>
<div> Confirmed Cases, Death Rates, and Recovered Cases are all important factors to examine when determining the transmission of disease 
  and its severity in a certain region. The grouped-bar chart below compares the world's top five most badly afflicted countries according 
  on three criteria: confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Instead of using individual bar charts, we used grouped bar charts, 
  which allow us to gather knowledge from a single graph. Rather just using bar charts to display the same information, various visualizations
   are required. Using three separate colors in a grouped bar chart might result in a visually appealing graph.
